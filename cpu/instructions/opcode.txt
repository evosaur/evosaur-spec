Binary format:
	is_conditional[1], instruction id[remaining bits]


is_conditional:
	Appends 1 parameter to the normal parameter list for the instruction:
		Lowest 3 bits: flags for each of the following checked, from lowest to highest:
			Zero
			Overflow
			Carry
		Next 3 bits:
			Value for each of the above that it should match
		Remaining bits:
			Index into instruction queue for which result is to be compared

	Conditional instructions will be executed after unconditional ones

	Conditional instructions will never set flags, if a conditional instruction references another, it will always be based on null flags
