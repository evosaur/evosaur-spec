Number of parameters:

Usage:
	save_condition <output> <offset> <conditional parameter>

conditional parameter: same as is_conditional from ../opcode.txt, but with the following changes:
	Values to be compared are instead xor'd

Effect:
	Saves the selected flags to <output> at bitwise position <offset>
		Flags are xor'd with the comparison value
		Resulting value is shifted down to not have gaps from unused flags

Exceptions:
	None

Notes:
	Will be executed in the conditional phase
