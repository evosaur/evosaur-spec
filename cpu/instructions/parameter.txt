NOTE: `required' refers to what the specification allows, not what the specific CPU allows. Format is not to be implementation dependent.

n: min number of bits required to be able to represent all parameter types
x: min size required to represent each power of two value less than or equal to the current mode (in bytes, and greater than or equal to 1)
y: min size to specify a particular segment register

Binary format:
	type[n], data[<type dependent>]


Types:
	Single immediate reference:
		Data size: x + [size of immediate value]
		data[0 to x-1]:
			Size of immediate value
		data[x to end]:
			Raw value

	Shared immediate reference:
		Data size: x + [minimum size required to represent an offset in the immediate references section]
		data[0 to x-1]:
			Size of immediate value

		data[x to end]:
			Offset into the array of immediate values

	Register:
		Data size: x + [minimum size required to specify any register]
		data[0 to x-1]:
			How much of the register to use

		data[x to end]:
			Which register to use

	Memory at single immediate reference:
		Uses RAM pointed to by the value as obtained in `single immediate reference` above
		SS0 will be used for filling in the segment with unspecified bits
		Prepends n bits to the data:
			data[0 to n-1]:
				Size of memory to use

	Memory at shared immediate reference:
		Uses RAM pointed to by the value as obtained in `shared immediate reference` above
		SS0 will be used for filling in the segment with unspecified bits
		Prepends n bits to the data:
			data[0 to n-1]:
				Size of memory to use

	Memory at register:
		Uses RAM pointed to by the value as obtained in `register` above
		SS0 will be used for filling in the segment with unspecified bits
		Prepends n bits to the data:
			data[0 to n-1]:
				Size of memory to use

	Memory at single immediate reference with segment override:
		Uses RAM pointed to by the value as obtained in `single immediate reference` above
		Prepends n + y bits to the data:
			data[0 to n-1]:
				Size of memory to use
			data[n to n+y-1]:
				Which segment register to use

	Memory at shared immediate reference with segment override:
		Uses RAM pointed to by the value as obtained in `shared immediate reference` above
		Prepends n + y bits to the data:
			data[0 to n-1]:
				Size of memory to use
			data[n to n+y-1]:
				Which segment register to use

	Memory at register with segment override:
		Uses RAM pointed to by the value as obtained in `register` above
		Prepends n + y bits to the data:
			data[0 to n-1]:
				Size of memory to use
			data[n to n+y-1]:
				Which segment register to use

	TODO: Will add more later

All memory references go through any configured translation thereof, unless specified otherwise
