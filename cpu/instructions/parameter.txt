n: min number of bits to be able to represent all types
TODO: define x

Binary format:
	type[n], data[x]


Types:
	Short immediate reference:
		Value is placed directly in the data section

	Immediate reference:
		y: min size required to represent each power of two value less than or equal to the current mode (in bytes, and greater than or equal to 1)
		data[0 to x-y-1]:
			size of immediate value

		data[x-y to x-1]:
			byte offset into the array of immediate values

	Register:
		data just to select which register

	Memory at immediate reference:
		Uses RAM pointed to by the value as obtained in `immediate reference` above

	Memory at register:
		Uses RAM pointed to by the value as obtained in `register` above

	TODO: Will add more later

All memory references go through any configured translation thereof, unless specified otherwise
