Unless otherwise specified, all arithmetic instructions:
	Set the zero flag when the result is 0
	Set the overflow flag when a signed operation results in inversion of the sign due to lack of bits to store the value
	Set the carry flag when an unsigned operation results in a lower number due to lack of bits to store the value
