Case 1: Full-width address given:
	Upper half is used as an index into the gdt, lower half is used as an offset within the segment

Case 2: Less than full width address given, segment selector specified:
	Fills missing bits of a full-width address with the high bits of the specified segment selector, then processes as in case 1

Case 3: Less than full width address given, no segment selector specified:
	Same as case 2, but uses upper half of IP for instructions implicitly modifying IP, and SS0 otherwise, as the segment selector
