When an interrupt occurs:
	OPRI gets set to the PR from the previous code running
	OIPI gets set to the IP from the previous code running
	PR is set to all 1s

The next interrupt will not occur until after the current processing has been finished via `ireti`

When returning via ireth:
	PR is set to OPRI
	Execution jumps to OIPI
