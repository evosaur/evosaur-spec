When a hardware interrut occurs:
	OPR gets set to the PR from the previous code running
	OIP gets set to the IP from the previous code running
	PR is set to all 1s

The next hardware interrupt will not occur until after the current processing has been finished via `ireth`

When returning via ireth:
	PR is set to OPR
	Execution jumps to OIP
