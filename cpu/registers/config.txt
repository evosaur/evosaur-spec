MR (Mode Register)
	CPU mode (16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, etc)

	Adjusts size according to current CPU mode

	On read
		Gives supported modes
			If ((1 << ([desired mode in bytes] - 1)) & cr0) != 0, then it is supported

			Support for 16-bit mode, 64-bit mode, 128-bit mode, and 256 bit mode would be represented as 111010b

	On write
		Sets current mode
			Follows the same pattern as reading
			100b would represent 32-bit mode

		Only one bit is allowed to be set
			Triggers <TODO> exception otherwise

		No need for a jump instruction immediately after it

PR (Privilege Register)
	Consists of flags for specific privileges
		Bit 0: Can configure everything
		All other bits are to be configured at runtime

	CPU initializes with it set to all 1s
	Always readable
	Writing directly is only allowed to remove permissions
		Triggers <TODO> exception otherwise

	Additional privileges can be granted by interrupts, exceptions and IRQs as configured by the IDT, EDT and IRQT, respectively

FR (Feature Register)
	Consists of various bit flags for different features that are currently enabled

	See features/all.txt for a full list

	Read only

OFR (Optional Feature Register)
	Consists of various bit flags for different features that can be enabled/disabled at runtime

	See features/all.txt for a full list

	On read:
		Lists features that can be enabled/disabled

	On write:
		Sets the configurable features, and ignores bits for non-configurable ones
