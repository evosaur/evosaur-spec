Of course, this is not ideal. We do want to use a strong copyleft
license, but the AGPL is not strong enough when it comes to patents.
License proliferation is harmful in that combining works become harder,
however this is less of a concern for Evosaur which seeks no
compatibility with the existing world of computing.
We don't want to risk it, so it's all rights reserved for now. Once
license selection (or perhaps development) finishes, we'll switch to
a strong copyleft license.
